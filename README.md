A real-time audio visualizer that creates dynamic visual effects responding to music. Built with HTML5 Canvas and Web Audio API, it offers three visualization styles: frequency bars, circular spectrum, and waveform. Simply upload an audio file or use your microphone to see the magic happen.
Upload an audio file (MP3, WAV, etc.) or click "Use Microphone", then press play to start visualizing. Switch between different styles using the dropdown menu. No installation required - just open and enjoy!
